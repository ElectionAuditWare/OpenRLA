# OpenRLA Assistant

## Development

You will need Node and NPM. Versions 7.1.0 and 3.10.9 respectively are
known to work. Install the project dependencies with `npm install`. To
compile the client ES2015 code to ES5, call the `build` script via `npm
run build`. Then, to run the compiled code via the Electron app, run
`npm start`.
